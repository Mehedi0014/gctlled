				</div>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>Fortunately, many kiosk software providers are fully capable of interfacing with different point-of-sale systems because they contain open APIs that work with the major systems. The only caveat might be if a POS system itself is not open to interfacing with other software programs. This can be the case for legacy POS systems or, to a lesser extent, modern POS systems where the vendor has opted to close off third-party software communications. When looking into a self-service kiosk program, kiosk-POS integration should be discussed early in the planning stages.</p>

					<p>Self-service kiosks are designed differently to withstand the environmental factors that come with being placed outside. In these instances, the structures must be designed and engineered to be weather-resistant, secure, durable and safe for all outdoor conditions.</p>

					<p>If you’re looking to utilize self-service kiosks outside, you’ll need to keep in mind that outdoor kiosks can cost much more than an indoor kiosk. This is because these kiosks must be more durable, watertight and insulated as well as include hardware components that are rated and ruggedized for the outdoors. Touchscreens need to be easily read in direct sunlight, and the exterior must handle exposure to heavy wind, rain and more. Additionally, mounting will need to be factored in along with climate control inside the kiosk to maintain temperature and humidity.</p>

					<p>When considering an outdoor option, make sure you’re aware of all the variables associated with ensuring a successful deployment.</p>

						<strong>3 characteristics of outdoor kiosks</strong>
						<br>
						Designed for 24/7 unattended outdoor use, users are able to interact with the solutions whenever it's most convenient for them, and business owners don't have to worry about missing out on potential customers when they're closed — everyone benefits.

						<strong>Design considerations for outdoor kiosks</strong>
						<br>
						Outdoor kiosks need to survive in harsh environments with brutal attacks from Mother Nature. Almost every aspect of an outdoor digital kiosk has to be scrutinized and designed properly to survive outdoor environments.
